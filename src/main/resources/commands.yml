# This is the commands configuration file for Velocity.
# This plugin is implemented like bukkit's commands aliases. It is the same as
# syntax for bukkit's commands.yml file.
# For documentation on how to make use of this file, check out the Bukkit Wiki at
# https://www.spigotmc.org/go/commands-yml 
# 
# Do not ask spigot team or something about this plugin
